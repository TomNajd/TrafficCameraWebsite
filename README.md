# TrafficCameraWebsite
One of my first coding projects from 5 years ago, first ever time coding any backend, used PHP and SQL in the backend. The task of this was to create a traffic app that manipulates a government API and displays the live traffic feed from speed cameras across queenslands. The API access has been shut since so this code no longer works.
