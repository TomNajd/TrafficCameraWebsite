# TrafficCameraWebsite
One of my first coding projects from 5 years ago, first ever time coding any backend, used PHP and SQL in the backend. The task of this was to create a traffic app that manipulates a government API and displays the live traffic feed from speed cameras across queenslands. The API access has been shut since so this code no longer works. However, it displays a deep knowledge of API manipulation using PHP and SQL and was an extremely fun project i worked countless days on. This was really a gateway project that opened my mind to the power of programming.

This was more of a backend knowledge project, so not much front end was written at all, However, from the login.php file a simple yet highly effective login form and the logic behind the login form interacting with an mySQL database is shown. Majority of the other code files are all just using php to pull and format information from the API before processing the information into a database to then be displayed on a website.
